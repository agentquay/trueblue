                    <p>Gently rinse and allow to air dry completely. One dry, place them in a single layer on a baking sheet and place in the freezer (2-3 hours). Place frozen blueberries in freezer bags. Remove as much air as possible before sealing as it will help prevent freezer burn.</p>

                    <h3>What should we wear to pick blueberries?</h3>
                    <p>Blueberries will stain your fingers and can also stain your clothes. We recommend that you don’t wear your favorite shirt or light colored clothing. Watch where you walk in our fields as fallen blueberries can stick to your shoes and stain carpeting. Sunglasses are not recommended as the tint can cause you to mistakenly pick under ripe berries.</p>

                    <h3>I’ve seen bee hives out in your fields in the spring time. How do bees help around a Blueberry Farm?</h3>
                    <p>Bees are essential to producing a good crop of blueberries. Their busy little bodies carry the pollen from blossom to blossom ensuring fruit set and large berries. </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <h4>Our own Jean Hartmann has this to say about our "Busy Bees":</h4>
                        <p>"I first became interested in honeybees about twelve years ago. It was a warm summer day after the bloom was finished in the blueberry fields. I was out throwing a ball for my dogs and heard a buzzing above my head.  I looked up and saw honeybees scurrying hurriedly in and out of the tree.  A small set was hovering outside waiting for their turn to enter and exit.  It was mesmerizing to me. It was like a well-choreographed routine in perceived chaos.</p>
                        <p>Every year after that I would go out and observe all the commercial bee keepers that service our fields. I would walk out to where they were yarded and watch them work.  I became inspired to enter the world of beekeeping on my own.   I wanted to have my own apiary.</p>
                        <p>The entire Hartmann family is dedicated to the blueberry industry. We strive to produce the best fruit and be a steward of the land. I was blessed through True Blue Farms to have some of the best apiaries help guide me through the growing pains of having my own hives. I am slowly building up my hives to be able to help service our farms and am excited to keep growing.</p>
                        <p>If you have seen the stories about honey bees in the news and want to lend a little support to our little friends, there are some easy things you can do help.  Plant some pollen rich plants around your house and property.  Even if you live in a condo, many apiaries are being placed on rooftops of buildings in urban areas.  A box planter will allow them to have something to collect pollen from.  If you see a swarm hanging on a tree branch don't go out and spray them with an insecticide.  A quick search of craigslist or a google search for honeybee clubs should provide you a list of qualified individuals that will come and provide the swarm a new home."
                        </p>

                    <h3>How do you protect your blueberries from frost in early Spring? </h3>
                    <p>You may have come across the image of a blueberry filed covered in ice on a frosty morning and wondered, "Why in the world would they turn on the sprinklers and put a layer of ice on our bushes?!" Well, there's a good reason! Ice is a poor insulator but as the above freezing temperature water is constantly applied via overhead sprinklers, there is a release of heat as the water turns to ice. This keeps the plant tissue at or above 32 degrees F, ensuring no or minimal damage to the bush. </p>
